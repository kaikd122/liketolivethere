                This means that we need your help! And so to encourage people to
                contribute reviews, we&apos;re running a monthly prize draw.
                Each month &#40;on the 1st&#41;, we&apos;ll pick a random user
                who has contributed at least one review &#40;not necessarily in
                that month&#41;, and they&apos;ll win a Â£20 Amazon voucher. The
                more reviews you contribute, the greater the chance you have of
                winning. If you win, we&apos;ll send the voucher to the email
                address you used to sign up.

                A review doesn&apos;t have to be a novel - the minimum length is
                just 200 characters, or about 40 words. The most important thing
                is that you&apos;re honest. So if you having anything to share,
                however small, that might help others, please do!
