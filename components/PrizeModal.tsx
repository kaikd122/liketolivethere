                More often than not, googling &ldquo;What&apos;s it like to live
                there?&rdquo; when you&apos;re interested in an area will give
                you a load of generic statistics like house prices, and
                propaganda from estate agents. When I was searching for a flat
                last year, I found that the most useful insights actually came
                from threads on forums like Mumsnet or The Student Room, as
                people were more likely to be &#40;sometimes brutally&#41;
                honest, and to focus on the aspects of living in an area that
                aren&apos;t captured well in statistics - answers to questions
                like &ldquo;Is there a good community spirit?&rdquo; and
                &ldquo;Does it feel safe?&rdquo;. And so I made Like To Live
                There as a platform to make it easy to share and discover these
                more personal insights.

                However, the platform is only as useful as the content it
                features. And so to encourage people to contribute reviews,
                I&apos;m running a monthly prize draw. Each month &#40;on the
                1st&#41;, I&apos;ll pick a random user who has contributed at
                least one review &#40;not necessarily in that month&#41;, and
                they&apos;ll win a Â£20 Amazon voucher. The more reviews you
                contribute, the greater the chance you have of winning. If you
                win, I&apos;ll send the voucher to the email address you used to
                sign up.

                A review doesn&apos;t have to be a novel - the minimum length is
                just 200 characters, or about 40 words. The most important thing
                is that you&apos;re honest. You don&apos;t have to be currently
                living in an area to review it - out of date reviews are still
                useful in building a picture of an area, and in suggesting how
                it might develop in the future. So if you having anything to
                share, however small, that might help others, please do!
